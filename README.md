CB-720 and DM-580 are both some notebooks that take SANDAG's public beach profile data and construct topographic beach profiles using distance and elevation.
After compiling the beach profiles for many years, we can graph the change in beach width and beach volume over time.

Torrey HS is a notebook that graphs NOAA's CDIP buoy data for significant wave height over time.
